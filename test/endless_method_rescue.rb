# Endless method with rescue modifier:
#   def name(args) = expr rescue fallback

# `rescue` modifier. This test
# pins int-typed-return shapes.

# Explicit-raise rescue trigger. Pre-fix the test was `half(n) = n / 2`,
# which never raises (0/2 == 0) and so never exercised the rescue path.
# Using raise() rather than `a / b` because Spinel's int-div on b==0 is
# C undefined behaviour (SIGFPE on x86) — outside the longjmp net the
# rescue keyword unwinds. The raise lives inside a helper so the endless
# body is a single call expression — keeps codegen happy and exercises
# the cross-frame rescue path.
